### What's email marketing?
- Email marketing is a digital marketing strategy that involves sending promotional messages or content to subscribers via email. This allows marketers to nurture relationships, generate leads, and drive sales.
### Why Is Email Marketing Important?
- Despite the rise of social media, people use email more than other platforms.
- Email marketing builds and strengthens customer relationships over time. That’s vital to growing your business because many consumers don’t buy at their first interaction.
- Highly targeted: Email segmentation allows you to target customers effectively, meaning they’re more likely to convert.
- Good for click-throughs: Emails provide a direct route to your website and can boost sales. Depending on the type of marketing message.
- According to HubSpot, four out of five marketers say they’d rather give up social media than email marketing.

### How email marketing works?
- An effective email marketing campaign requires three essential elements:
   1. An Email List: An email list is a database of subscribers who have agreed to let you send them emails.To build successful email campaigns, you need a list of active, engaged email users.There are many ways to build an email list. One of the easiest is to create a lead magnet (also called an offer) that your target audience is interested in. A common example is offering a coupon in exchange for email addresses.
   2. An Email Service Provider: An email service provider (ESP), also known as an email marketing platform, is software that helps you manage your email list and design and execute automated email campaigns.You can use an ESP to create automatic triggers when your audience completes specific actions, such as sending a cart reminder if a user adds an item to their cart and doesn’t check out. These triggers enable you to personalize interactions to improve engagement and open rates.
   3. Clearly Defined Goals: 
- To execute an effective email marketing campaign, your email list, ESP, and goals must align. Then, you can get to work:
### what can we do by email marketing?
- lead generation, sales, and content marketing.

### Advantages of Email Marketing
- `It’s permission-based: `When a customer trusts you with their email address, it’s the virtual equivalent of being given the keys to their house. Gaining permission to enter rather than showing up uninvited increases the chances of engagement and conversion.
- `It provides direct access to your audience:` You can communicate directly with subscribers on their schedules. Plus, because most people check email multiple times daily, subscribers are more likely to view your message.
- `Email provides more control:` With most other marketing platforms, you don’t own the platform. If the platform ceases to exist, all your hard work sinks with it. If Google or Facebook updates their algorithm, your reach could take a hit. However, with email, you own the relationships you forge with your subscribers.
- `It offers more personalization capabilities:` You can use demographic or psychographic data to create personalized and hyper-targeted campaigns. Research shows segmented and personalized campaigns increase revenue by as much as 760 percent.
- `It’s easy to measure success:` Measuring the effectiveness of a marketing campaign is crucial, and automated email marketing makes measuring your campaign a breeze.
- `It’s scalable:` Email marketing campaigns can easily scale as your audience grows without straining your resources or compromising quality.

### Disadvantages of Email Marketing 
- `You need an email list:` For email marketing campaigns to be effective, you must already have an email list. Building an email list can be tricky and takes time.
- `Delivery and deliverability issues:` Deliverability is not guaranteed. Many email providers (think Gmail or Outlook) use spam filters. To run effective email marketing campaigns, you must contend with delivery and deliverability issues.

### The Fundamentals of Email Marketing
- `Stay Human:`Showing your human side is an absolute must if you want to gain loyal customers and increase conversions. Why? Because research shows that readers are 26 percent more likely to open personalized subject lines. Consumers like to feel that you’re talking to them personally. The way you address them can make all the difference.
-` Use Engaging Titles, But Don’t Bait and Switch:` Interesting subject titles are crucial to increasing email open rates, but keep them on topic and non-spammy. If users feel duped, they’re likely to unsubscribe or mark your message as spam, which impacts deliverability.
   - To prevent this, concentrate on creating subject lines that reflect the content of your emails and use action-oriented language. It’s OK to use emails that cause a sense of urgency or excitement, but avoid exaggeration.
   - Use subject lines like:

      Don’t miss out on this limited time offer!
      Join the community today and exclusive perks
      Last chance to save
      You’re invited
      Just ensure you use accurate headlines so you don’t disappoint subscribers when they click through.
- `Keep Messages Short:` Many consumers read their emails on a mobile device, so keep your copy concise and to the point. One suggestion is to keep your emails between 50 and 125 words. It’s also worth noting that emails of up to 50 words can have up to a 50 percent conversion rate, according to Campaign Monitor.If you need to add more info for context, then use easy-to-scan bullet points or numbered lists.Direct users to a blog post or landing page if you need to share a ton of information. Doing this keeps your emails concise and lets readers access the content in their own time. 
- `Ask Permission and Deliver On Your Promises: ` Never buy email lists—that is illegal in most cases and won’t deliver ROI. If you offer a great deal or high-quality content, make sure to deliver just that. 
If you do buy an email list, know that you’re likely to get a low response rate. Why? Because you’re reaching out to people who haven’t opted in and have little interest in your offer.
A better approach is creating your email list organically by providing valuable content, tailored offers, or incentives. To improve engagement, don’t just try to sell. Instead, draw people in with stories or solutions to their problems.
Finally, add a double-opt-in for your new subscribers, and make it easy for your list to unsubscribe.
### Getting Started With Email Marketing 
- If you open your email inbox right now, there’s a good chance at least half your messages are email marketing

### Decide How to Segment Your Email Marketing List
- If you’re unfamiliar with the term, email segmentation is the practice of splitting up your email list into more targeted groups.
   - Here are a few ways to segment your list:
      Customer list (in comparison to leads who haven’t bought)
      Newsletter subscribers
      Daily email list (in comparison to weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.)
      Demographics, such as age, location, or job title
      Interests, such as marketing or sales topics
- Email responders allow you to segment your audience based on their interests and behaviors. 

### What Is Automated Email Marketing?
- Automated email marketing is a series of emails you automatically send to your prospects or customers. Using an autoresponder, you can schedule emails to send based on your audience’s interactions with your business.
- When to Use Automated Email Marketing
   - ` Abandoned Carts:` Abandoned carts are highly frustrating. The person has gotten so close to making a purchase, yet you’ve lost them at the last moment. There are many reasons why people abandon carts, but a common one is that they’re not quite ready to buy yet. Just because someone isn’t ready to buy today doesn’t mean they won’t be soon, and an automated email is a perfect way to keep them engaged. When someone abandons their cart, you can schedule an email to go out to them, prompting them to return and complete their purchase. The average cart abandonment rate is estimated to be 77.13 percent, so bringing people back to your checkout page through well-timed emails can be invaluable. 
   - `Sending Automated Email Newsletters to Subscribers:` Once someone leaves your website, you may never see them again. If you’ve got their email address, you’ve got an opportunity to keep the connection alive and build a relationship (hopefully until they become a repeat customer). Just having someone’s email doesn’t achieve this, though, and instead, you’ve got to be able to offer something valuable.In the case of a newsletter, you’re offering your amazing content to grow the relationship and keep bringing people back to your website.
   -  `Promotional Emails:` 
   - `Welcome Emails:` When someone signs up for your email communication, it’s a good idea to send out a welcome email. Of course, you can’t be on your computer all the time, monitoring the moment everyone signs up for emails, so this is something that is best to automate. It allows you to set expectations and explain the value proposition of receiving your emails. Once someone has a good idea of what they’re going to receive from your emails, they’re more likely to open them and interact with your content. 
   - `Automatic Replies to Customer Complaints:` When someone has a complaint, they want to be assured you’re taking it seriously. The longer they wait for a response, the more their frustration builds. You can’t be monitoring your inbox 24/7, so it’s just not possible to be able to respond to each complaint right away. What you can do is set up an automated email that explains your complaint process and ensures you’re working on fixing the issue. This gives people confidence that you’re taking their complaints seriously, and they can expect a response in due course.
