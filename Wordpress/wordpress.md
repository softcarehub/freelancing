## Wordpress.com
- You don’t have to find a host because WordPress.com is your host. it has one of the best free hosting options out there. If you are looking for a 100% free site where you can get started from nothing in essentially moments, you can do that here. No hosting costs and no domain registration; just sign up and go.They also handle backups and maintenance and upgrades for you. Meaning that you won’t have to worry about your site getting security holes in it from not having X, Y, or Z plugin at its newest version.

 - WordPress.com also shows ads on your site and doesn’t pay you for them. At least, if you’re a free member. The saying “if you’re not paying for a product, you are the product” holds very true here. 
 - You cannot use external services such as Google Analytics or Google AdSense, but you can apply for their proprietary ad system and use Jetpack stats. Unless, of course, you upgrade to a higher plan.
 - And finally, you are bound by the WordPress.com EULA and ToS. Which means that they have the right to do with your site what they want. While you own the content there, they may choose to use it in advertising. And if they decide your content violates their terms, they can take your site offline without your consent (or knowledge, sometimes). 
 - FREE to use but	Only basic elements are free
 - Easy set up but	Certain plugins are prohibited
 - Hosting is provided but	Ads are shown that you don't get paid for
 - Free domain but	Custom domain costs extra
 - JetPack provided	but No Google Analytics integration
 - Security is provided but	You don't own your content


 - What is the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com?
  - WordPress.org is free software you install on your web host. You have full control but handle maintenance. WordPress.com is a hosted service where you create a site without installing anything. It's easier but has limitations unless you pay. The main difference is control vs. convenience.
